     <h2>About Me</h2>
     <p>
        I am an author who started her serious journey as a writer and an artist in 2013 when I published for the first time, in my artist portfolio, some of my words and artistic work. My direction was from the very beginning of the publishing journey an experimental one, touched by poetic views and abstract thinking. My school formation is in great part formed of Western languages studies and aspects of Western Europe culture but not only. 
 </p>
<p>In April 2018 I published as an e-book my first volume of poetry titled “Time Files”. Other volumes of diverse poetry followed along with artwork creation. So appeared the hybrid “Prism Tears” (2018-06-05) and the visual brochures added works for “Time Files” and “In T[I’m]” (2018-06-25), with a little imagery ad for “The Hour of the Blue Man” (2018-06-06) and the illustrations created for the covers of each of my books published until 2020 when I decided to consciously use other people’s art in my book covers creation and projects. So emerged “Natural” (2020-12-09) and “Christmas Afflatus” (2021-01-12) published with the use of other photographers; “Under a Starry Sky” with a thematic artistically adapted to surreal fantasy visuals collage composition was published in 2020-12-20. In 2021 “Soul Crush” brings me back to my natural habit of making it all myself from scratch. Covers and poetry wish to be more simple with a little didactic material inserted.
 </p>
    <p>On May 29, 2020, I published my first book in the trilogy “Phantomaniacs”, a dark fantasy novel dedicated to youth with action developed in Europe. Previously to this fantasy book, I published a fantasy story titled “Moons of Amaterasu” (2020-03-29) inspired by Japanese culture and mythology. Other writing pieces created also to promote aspects of the universal culture I embraced and fell in love with, along with poetry volumes were published. In 2020-2021 I returned, though, to an old high-school love affair: theatre and playwrighting. On May, 13, 2021, “Perceptions: Open Skies Collections” is published, an anthology of poetry to which I gladly contributed. On October 21, 2021, my first play written in English is published, “Trolleo and Henriette” followed by its sequel “Interview with the Blue Door”. The month of December, of the same year brings the publication of another anthology in which I participated, “Quintessence: Coming of Age” (2021-12-25). I’m  self-published on Spillwords.com and Amazon.com.

    </p>
    <p>“Bus Station Bookmarks” is my free verse collection published at the end of 2022 for the start of the year 2023. Along came my free-verse poetry written in Romanian, “Fluturi Întemnițați”, also included in my BSB, reading in public spaces project and study. The other works programmed to be launched and published for this project are two Romanian pieces, “Gogoșari de Marțipan”, a collection of verses, and “Datori a fi Moddeli” a humorous three acts play and English work like “Sweet Talk” and “A Change of Heart”, another three acts play, with two versions of “Noir” coming up next, one in English and one in Romanian, each slightly different. In 2024 I was invited to participate in the Romanian cultural magazine “Yeseuri”. I also publish poetry and articles in “Meridiane Culturale” another local cultural magazine.
